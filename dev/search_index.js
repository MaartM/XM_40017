We use Julia instead to make the course accessible to a wider set of students, including the ones that have no experience with  C/C++ or Fortran, but are willing to learn parallel programming. Julia is a relatively new programming language specifically designed for scientific computing. It combines a high-level syntax close to interpreted languages like Python with the performance of compiled languages like C, C++, or Fortran. Thus, Julia will allow us to write efficient parallel algorithms with a syntax that is convenient in a teaching setting. In addition, Julia provides easy access to different programming models to write distributed algorithms, which will be useful to learn and experiment with them.","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started_with_julia/","page":"Getting started","title":"Getting started","text":"tip: Tip\nYou can run the code in this link to learn how Julia compares to other languages (C and Python) in terms of performance.","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started_with_julia/#Installing-Julia","page":"Getting started","title":"Installing Julia","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"getting_started_with_julia/","page":"Getting started","title":"Getting started","text":"This is a tutorial-like page.

Running code in a cluster (like in DAS-5 for the Julia assignment) is among the few situations you need to run Julia code from the terminal.
